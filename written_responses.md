1. What is a regular expression and how does it work?

    A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, it can be used in different algorithms for manipulating string or basically any kind of text to perform 'find' or 'find and replace' operations. Regex are compatible with almost all programing languages. It works as a finite state machine, trying to match each patters letter by letter, where each valid combination would be a different state, but as soon as it fails, it starts over from the beggining and move onto the next possible match. A regex always return the leftmost match.
